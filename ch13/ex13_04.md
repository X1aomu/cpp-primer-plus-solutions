## Answers to Programming Exercises in Chapter 13

### a.

__Q__: Your first task is to re-create the Port method definitions because the former Portmaster immolated his upon being relieved.

__A__: See `ch13/port.cc` .

### b.

__Q__: Your second task is to explain why certain methods are redefined and others are not.

__A__: It depends on whether the internal implementation of a function in the derived class and base class is the same.

### c.

__Q__: Your third task is to explain why operator=() and operator<<() are not virtual.

__A__: For operator=(), it is because a function's signature needs to be the same for virtual to come into play and usually a derived class's function signature of an overloaded operator is not the same as its parents. See [virtual assignment operator C++ - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/669818/virtual-assignment-operator-c) to learn more.
As for operator<<(), it is not even a member function, thus it can not be virtual.

### d.

__Q__: Your fourth task is to provide definitions for the VintagePort methods.

__A__: See `ch13/port.cc` .
