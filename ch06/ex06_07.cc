/// This file is a solution to the programming exercise 07 in chapter 06 of Cpp
/// Primer Plus 6th Edition.
///
/// Write a program that reads input a word at a time until a lone q is
/// entered. The program should then report the number of words that began with
/// vowels, the number that began with consonants, and the number that fit
/// neither of those categories. One approach is to use isalpha() to
/// discriminate between words beginning with letters and those that donâ€™t and
/// then use an if or switch statement to further identify those passing the
/// isalpha() test that begin with vowels. A sample run might look like this:
///
/// Enter words (q to quit):
/// The 12 awesome oxen ambled
/// quietly across 15 meters of lawn. q
/// 5 words beginning with vowels
/// 4 words beginning with consonants
/// 2 others
